Silly little AHK script that shortens a URL using the waa.ai URL shortening service :)

## How 2 Use
1. Run the url.ahk script
2. Copy a link (any link will do!!)
3. Press CTRL+W
4. Paste and you will now noticed it's been shortened to a waa.ai link :)

## Dependencies
I've only ever tested this using python 3.8.12 but I'm sure it'll work on any ver. of Python 3!!!!! Obviously you also need AutoHotkey installed
